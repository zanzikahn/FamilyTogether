## 🚀 How to Start Autonomous Development

### Option 1: Simple Command (Recommended)

Open Claude Code in this directory and paste:

```
Read and follow INITIATE_DEVELOPMENT.md. Begin autonomous development of the FamilyTogether platform starting with Phase 1. Create CHANGELOG.md and PROJECT_STATE.md immediately, then begin with Task 1.1: Supabase Database Setup. Report progress after each task completion.
```

### Option 2: Detailed Approach

1. **Read** `HOW_TO_START_DEVELOPMENT.md` for complete instructions
2. **Copy** entire contents of `INITIATE_DEVELOPMENT.md`
3. **Paste** into Claude Code
4. **Watch** as Claude builds the entire project autonomously

---

## 📋 What Will Happen

### Immediate Actions (First 5 minutes)
1. Claude reads CLAUDE.md reference guide
2. Creates CHANGELOG.md for tracking all work
3. Creates PROJECT_STATE.md for current state
4. Creates TodoWrite list for Phase 1 tasks
5. Begins Task 1.1: Supabase Database Setup

### Phase 1: Foundation (~2 hours)
- ✅ Supabase database setup with all tables
- ✅ ASP.NET Core API project created
- ✅ Authentication implemented (register, login, logout)
- ✅ 4 core API endpoints working
- ✅ API deployed to Railway
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline configured
- 📊 Reports completion and waits for your approval

### Phase 2: SPA Development (~4 hours)
- After your approval, Claude proceeds
- IndexedDB setup and wrapper
- Authentication UI
- Family and task management UI (offline-first)
- Sync implementation
- Deploy to Netlify
- 📊 Reports completion and waits for approval

### Phases 3-6: Continue Pattern
- Each phase completes autonomously
- Claude reports completion
- You approve to proceed to next phase
- Full project complete in 12-18 hours

---

## 📊 Tracking Progress

### Three Tracking Mechanisms

1. **CHANGELOG.md** - Detailed log of all completed work
   - Updated after each task
   - Shows exactly what was done
   - Includes decisions made and problems solved

2. **PROJECT_STATE.md** - Current state snapshot
   - Shows overall progress percentage
   - Lists what's working and what's not
   - Tracks deployment URLs
   - Shows test coverage
   - Lists any blockers

3. **TodoWrite Tool** - Granular task tracking
   - Real-time task status in Claude Code UI
   - Shows current task in progress
   - Tracks pending vs completed tasks

### Check Progress Anytime

```
Show me the current PROJECT_STATE.md
```

```
What's the latest in CHANGELOG.md?
```

```
Provide a status update on current progress
```
