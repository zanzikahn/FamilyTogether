### Task 2.3: Railway Deployment Challenges & Resolution ✅
**Issue**: Railway aggressively cached builds, preventing .NET 8.0 deployment

**13 Deployment Attempts Over 3.5 Hours**:
1. Standard `railway up` deployment → Cached .NET 6.0
2. GitHub Actions workflow → Invalid token
3. `railway redeploy --yes` → Still cached
4. Added nixpacks.toml configuration → Still cached
5. Cleaned build artifacts (`rm -rf bin/ obj/`) → Still cached
6. Added .railwayignore file → Still cached
7. Created debug endpoint → 404 not found
8. Code change to force rebuild → Still cached
9. **Recreated Railway service from scratch → SUCCESS!**
10. Fixed AuthService deadlock issue → App starts
11. Removed conflicting config files → Clean build
12. Updated Supabase publishable key → Auth working
13. Fixed database connection string → Fully operational

**Critical Fixes Applied**:
- [COMPLETED] AuthService deadlock fix (removed `.Wait()` in constructor)
  - Implemented lazy async initialization with `EnsureSupabaseInitializedAsync()`
  - Added SemaphoreSlim for thread-safe initialization
  - Prevents deadlock during dependency injection
- [COMPLETED] Removed conflicting railway.toml and nixpacks.toml
  - Let Railway auto-detect .NET 8.0
  - Manually configured health check in dashboard
- [COMPLETED] Updated to new Supabase key format
  - Changed from legacy `anon` key to `sb_publishable__*` format
  - Reference: https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/29260
- [COMPLETED] Fixed PostgreSQL connection string formatting
  - Changed `SSL Mode` → `SslMode` (no spaces)
  - Changed `Trust Server Certificate` → `TrustServerCertificate` (no spaces)

**Final Deployment Status**: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL
- Production URL: https://familytogether-production.up.railway.app
- Framework: .NET 8.0.23
- Health Check: ✅ Working
- Debug Endpoint: ✅ Working
- Auth Endpoints: ✅ Working (Supabase integration)
- Database Connection: ✅ Working (PostgreSQL via Supabase)
- JWT Authentication: ✅ Working

### Task 2.4: SPA Configuration Updates ✅
- [COMPLETED] Updated config.js with new Railway URL
  - Changed: charming-magic-production.up.railway.app → familytogether-production.up.railway.app
- [COMPLETED] Updated config.js with new Supabase publishable key
  - Changed: legacy `anonKey` → `publishableKey: sb_publishable__*`
- [COMPLETED] All changes committed to GitHub

### Task 2.5: Documentation ✅
- [COMPLETED] Created RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md (326 lines)
  - Comprehensive deployment timeline
  - All fixes documented with code examples
  - Lessons learned section
  - Configuration reference
- [COMPLETED] Updated CLAUDE.md to version 1.1
  - Updated all .NET 6.0 references to .NET 8.0
  - Updated package versions to 8.0.0
  - Added Railway deployment gotchas section
  - Added blocking async calls in constructors gotcha

### Progress Summary
**Phase 2 Progress**: 75% Complete 🔄
- ✅ Task 2.1: SPA Services Development (100%)
- ✅ Task 2.2: API Upgrade to .NET 8.0 (100%)
- ✅ Task 2.3: Railway Deployment (100%)
- ✅ Task 2.4: SPA Configuration Updates (100%)
- ✅ Task 2.5: Documentation (100%)
- ⏸️ Task 2.6: SPA Integration (0% - ready to start)

**Overall Project Progress**: ~40% Complete

### Technical Achievements
- **Local-First Architecture**: All 5 core services implemented following PRD spec
- **Hybrid Storage Strategy**: localStorage + IndexedDB working together
- **Sync Manager**: Background sync, conflict resolution, offline queue operational
- **Modern Stack**: Upgraded to .NET 8.0 LTS with latest packages
- **Production-Ready Code**: Error handling, logging, type safety throughout
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: README, code comments, integration guide, deployment report

### Key Lessons Learned
1. **Railway Build Cache**: When stuck after 3+ deployment attempts, recreate the service
2. **Async Deadlocks**: Never use `.Wait()` or `.Result` in constructors - use lazy initialization
3. **Supabase Keys**: Use new `sb_publishable__*` format, not legacy `anon` keys
4. **Connection Strings**: PostgreSQL requires no spaces in property names (e.g., `SslMode` not `SSL Mode`)
5. **Config Conflicts**: Don't create both `railway.toml` and `nixpacks.toml` simultaneously

### Next Steps
**Ready to proceed with Task 2.6: SPA Integration**
- Add Supabase CDN to index.html
- Import ES modules (db.js, api.js, auth.js, sync.js)
- Replace localStorage CRUD with IndexedDB calls
- Add sync queue triggers
- Test offline functionality
- Deploy to Netlify
