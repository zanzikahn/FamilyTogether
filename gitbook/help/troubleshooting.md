## Login Problems

## Points Problems

<details>
<summary><strong>⭐ My points didn't go up after completing a task</strong></summary>

### Most likely cause:
Your task is still **pending approval**.

### How to check:
Look at the task card. Is it:
- **Yellow?** → Still waiting for parent approval
- **Red?** → Was rejected, needs to be redone
- **Shows "Completed"?** → Points should be there

### Solution:
Ask a parent to approve your pending task.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📉 My points went down but I didn't buy anything</strong></summary>

### Possible causes:
- Someone else used your account
- Parent manually adjusted your points
- You forgot you claimed a reward

### Solution:
Ask a parent to check and possibly adjust your points in the Admin Panel.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔄 All my points are gone</strong></summary>

### Possible causes:
- Parent used "Reset Points" in Admin Panel
- Data was cleared
- Using different browser/device

### Solutions:
- Ask a parent what happened
- Parent can import a recent backup
- Parent can manually set your points

</details>

## Task Problems

<details>
<summary><strong>❌ My task was rejected</strong></summary>

### What to do:
1. **Read the rejection reason** on the red task card
2. **Fix the issue** in real life
3. **Click "Resubmit"** when done properly
4. **Wait** for parent to review again

### Tips:
- Don't be upset — it's a chance to improve!
- Ask the parent what specifically needs fixing
- Do a better job the second time

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>👀 I can't see any tasks</strong></summary>

### Possible causes:
- No tasks are assigned to you
- All tasks are already completed
- Looking at wrong category

### Solutions:
- Check all three tabs: Daily, Weekly, Monthly
- Ask a parent to assign tasks to you
- Check if tasks are assigned to "Everyone" or your name

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>⏳ My task is stuck on "Pending" forever</strong></summary>

### Solution:
Remind a parent to check the Admin Panel for pending approvals!

Parents need to:
1. Log in to their account
2. Go to Admin Panel
3. Find your task in "Pending Approvals"
4. Click Approve or Reject

## Admin Panel Problems

<details>
<summary><strong>⚙️ I can't see the Admin button</strong></summary>

### Cause:
Your account is set as "Child," not "Parent."

### Solution (if you should be a parent):
1. Have another parent log in
2. Go to Admin Panel → Family Members
3. Edit your profile
4. Change Role to "Parent"
5. Save

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>💾 Changes aren't saving</strong></summary>

### Check these things:
1. Is auto-save enabled? (Should show green indicator)
2. Are you in private/incognito mode? (Won't save!)
3. Is your browser allowing local storage?

### Solutions:
- Turn on auto-save
- Don't use private browsing
- Try a different browser
- Click "Save Now" manually

## Display Problems

<details>
<summary><strong>🖥️ The app looks broken or weird</strong></summary>

### Solutions to try:

1. **Refresh the page** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
2. **Clear browser cache** and reload
3. **Try a different browser**
4. **Make sure you're opening the correct file**

### If nothing works:
The HTML file may be corrupted. Re-download or restore from backup.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📱 App doesn't fit my screen</strong></summary>

## Data Problems

<details>
<summary><strong>💨 All my data is gone!</strong></summary>

### Possible causes:
- Browser data was cleared
- Different browser/device
- Someone clicked "Clear All"
- Private browsing mode

### Solutions:

{% hint style="success" %}
**If you have a backup file:**
1. Open the app
2. Go to Admin Panel
3. Click "Import Backup"
4. Select your backup file
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**If you don't have a backup:**
Unfortunately, the data cannot be recovered. You'll need to start fresh with "Clear All" and re-create everything.

**Lesson learned:** Always keep backup files!
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📤 Export/Import isn't working</strong></summary>

### For Export problems:
- Check if downloads are blocked in your browser
- Try a different browser

- File may be corrupted — try a different backup

## Reward Problems

<details>
<summary><strong>🎁 I can't afford any rewards</strong></summary>

### Solutions:
- Keep completing tasks to earn more points!
- Focus on higher-point tasks (weekly/monthly)
- Ask a parent if there are smaller rewards available
- Be patient — saving takes time

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>💸 I claimed a reward but want my points back</strong></summary>

### Unfortunately:
Reward claims are instant and cannot be undone automatically.

### Ask a parent to:
1. Manually add the points back to your balance
2. (But they might say no — be careful what you click!)
