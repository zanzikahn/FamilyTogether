## General Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Does FamilyTogether work offline?</strong></summary>

**Yes!** 

FamilyTogether works entirely offline. It doesn't need internet to:
- Log in
- Complete tasks
- Earn points
- Redeem rewards

All data is stored in your browser's local storage on your device.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use FamilyTogether on my phone?</strong></summary>

**Yes!**

FamilyTogether works in any mobile browser (Safari, Chrome, etc.). The interface automatically adjusts for smaller screens.

**Note:** Each device has its own separate data. To sync between devices, use the Export/Import backup feature.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is my data private?</strong></summary>

**Yes!**

All data stays on YOUR device in the browser's local storage. Nothing is sent to the internet or any servers. Only people with access to your device can see your data.

## Points & Rewards

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I get a refund on a reward I claimed?</strong></summary>

**Not automatically.**

Once you click on a reward, the points are deducted instantly. However, a parent can manually add points back to your balance if they choose to.

**Tip:** Think carefully before claiming rewards!

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why didn't I get my points?</strong></summary>

**Most likely:** Your task is still pending approval.

Check your task card:
- **Yellow** = Waiting for parent approval
- **Red** = Rejected (needs to be redone)
- **"Completed"** = Approved, points should be there

Ask a parent to approve your pending tasks.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can parents earn points too?</strong></summary>

**Yes!**

Parents can complete tasks just like kids. The difference:
- Parent completions are **automatically approved** (no waiting)
- Parents earn points immediately

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the point multiplier?</strong></summary>

The point multiplier increases (or decreases) points earned:

| Multiplier | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| 1.0x | Normal points |
| 1.5x | 50% bonus |
| 2.0x | Double points! |

Parents can change this in Settings for special occasions like weekends or holidays.

## Tasks

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the difference between "Everyone" and "Individual" tasks?</strong></summary>

**"Everyone" task (Individual OFF):**
- Only ONE person needs to complete it
- First person to complete gets the points
- Example: Vacuum the living room

**"Everyone" task (Individual ON):**
- EACH person needs to complete it separately
- Everyone earns their own points
- Example: Make your own bed

Look for the "Individual task" badge on task cards.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I complete a task not assigned to me?</strong></summary>

**It depends on the assignment:**

| Assigned To | Can You Complete? |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Everyone | ✅ Yes |
| Kids | ✅ If you're a kid |
| Specific person | ❌ Only that person |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I did a task but forgot to submit it?</strong></summary>

**You can still submit it!**

As long as the task hasn't been reset (daily tasks reset each day, etc.), you can submit it anytime.

**Going forward:** Try to submit right after completing the task so you don't forget.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why was my task rejected?</strong></summary>

**Common reasons:**
- Task wasn't done completely
- Quality wasn't good enough
- Missed spots or areas
- Didn't follow instructions properly

**What to do:**
1. Read the rejection reason on the red task card
2. Fix the issue in real life
3. Click "Resubmit" when done properly

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>When do tasks reset?</strong></summary>

Tasks don't reset automatically. A parent must click the reset buttons:

| Reset Type | When to Use |
|------------|-------------|
| Reset Daily | Every morning |
| Reset Weekly | Start of each week |
| Reset Monthly | Start of each month |

## Accounts & Login

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I forget my password?</strong></summary>

**For kids:** Ask a parent to look up your password in the Admin Panel (Family Members → Edit → Password is visible).

**For parents:** Another parent can check, or you can look in a backup file.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why is my account locked?</strong></summary>

**Too many wrong password attempts.**

After 3 wrong tries, accounts lock for 5 minutes. Just wait, then try again with the correct password.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I change my avatar?</strong></summary>

**Yes, but you need a parent to do it.**

1. Parent goes to Admin Panel
2. Family Members → Edit your profile
3. Click a different avatar emoji
4. Save

</details>

## Data & Backup

<details>
<summary><strong>Where is my data stored?</strong></summary>

**In your browser's local storage.**

This means:
- ✅ Data stays on your device (private)
- ✅ Works offline
- ⚠️ Clearing browser data deletes it
- ⚠️ Different browser = different data
- ⚠️ Different device = different data

**Solution:** Export backups regularly!

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I sync between devices?</strong></summary>

**Not automatically**, but you can use Export/Import:

1. Export backup from Device A
2. Transfer the file to Device B
3. Import backup on Device B

This is a manual process — changes don't sync automatically.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I lost all my data! Can I get it back?</strong></summary>

**Only if you have a backup file.**

If you have a backup:
1. Open FamilyTogether
2. Go to Admin Panel → Import Backup
3. Select your backup file

If you don't have a backup:
- Unfortunately, the data cannot be recovered
- You'll need to start fresh

**Lesson:** Always keep regular backups!
