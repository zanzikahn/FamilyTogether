# Approving Tasks

One of the most important parent jobs is reviewing and approving tasks that kids submit.

## Why Approval Matters

{% hint style="info" %}
**The approval system teaches accountability!**

Kids learn that:
- Work should be done properly
- Someone will check their work
- Quality matters
- Honesty is important
{% endhint %}

---

## Finding Pending Tasks

In the Admin Panel, look for the **"⏳ Pending Task Approvals"** section.

If there are tasks waiting, you'll see them listed here. If the section says "No tasks pending approval," you're all caught up!

---

## Pending Task Information

Each pending task shows:

| Information | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Task Name** | What was supposed to be done |
| **Submitted by** | Which child submitted it |
| **Points** | How many points they'll earn if approved |
| **Submitted** | Date and time of submission |

## Approving a Task

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Check the Real Work

Before approving in the app, physically verify the chore was done!

- Did they actually do it?
- Was it done properly?
- Is the quality acceptable?
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Click Approve

If the work is satisfactory, click the **✅ Approve** button.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Points Awarded

The child automatically receives their points. A confirmation message appears.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**After Approval:**

- Points are instantly added to the child's balance
- The task shows as "Completed & Approved" on their dashboard
- They can see who approved it and when
{% endhint %}

## Rejecting a Task

Sometimes a task isn't done well enough. Here's how to reject it constructively:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Identify the Problem

What specifically wasn't done right?
- Missed spots?
- Incomplete?
- Rushed job?
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Click Reject

Click the **❌ Reject** button on the pending task.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Enter a Reason

A prompt appears asking for a rejection reason.

**Be specific and helpful!** This feedback helps the child improve.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Submit Rejection

Click OK to confirm. The child will see your feedback.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Be Constructive, Not Critical**

Good rejection reasons help kids learn. Bad ones just frustrate them.
{% endhint %}

---

## Good vs. Bad Rejection Reasons

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="✅ Good Reasons" %}
### Helpful Feedback

- "Please wipe under the edges of the table too"
- "The bed sheets aren't tucked in properly"
- "You missed the area behind the toilet"
- "Dishes still have food residue - please rewash"
- "Please fold the clothes instead of stuffing them"

These are specific and tell the child exactly what to fix!
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="❌ Bad Reasons" %}
### Unhelpful Feedback

- "Do it again"
- "Not good enough"
- "Try harder"
- "Wrong"
- "No"

These don't explain what's wrong or how to improve!
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

---

## What Happens After Rejection

1. The task card on the child's dashboard turns **red**
2. Your rejection reason is displayed
3. A **"🔄 Resubmit"** button appears
4. The child can fix the issue and resubmit
5. The task returns to your pending queue

```
Rejected → Child sees reason → Child fixes issue → Resubmits → 
Back to your pending approvals → Approve or Reject again
```

---

## Tips for Approvals

### Be Consistent

Apply the same standards for all children and all tasks. Kids notice unfairness!

### Be Timely

Try to review pending tasks promptly. Kids get frustrated waiting.

### Be Encouraging

When approving, you might say something positive in person:
- "Great job on the bathroom!"
- "The kitchen looks spotless!"

### Be Fair with Rejections

Only reject if the task genuinely needs improvement. Don't reject for minor issues.

---

## Bulk Situations

### Many Pending Tasks?

Work through them one at a time. There's no bulk approve feature — each task should be individually verified.

### Same Child, Multiple Tasks?

Review each task separately. They might have done some well and others poorly.

---

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Task done well | ✅ Approve |
| Task not done at all | ❌ Reject with "Please complete this task" |
| Task done poorly | ❌ Reject with specific feedback |
| Task done but not quite right | Your judgment - approve or give another chance |
| Not sure if done | Go check in person, then decide |
