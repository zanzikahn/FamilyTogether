### Point Multiplier

Control how many points tasks are worth.

| Value | Effect | When to Use |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **1.0** | Normal points (default) | Regular days |
| **1.5** | 50% bonus | Special occasions |
| **2.0** | Double points! | Holidays, motivation boost |
| **0.5** | Half points | Rarely needed |

{% hint style="success" %}
**Fun Idea: Double Points Weekend!**

Set the multiplier to 2.0 on weekends or holidays to encourage extra cleaning!
{% endhint %}

#### How It Works:

If a task is worth 5 points:
- At 1.0x: Earns 5 points
- At 1.5x: Earns 8 points (7.5 rounded)
- At 2.0x: Earns 10 points

### Max Login Attempts

How many wrong password tries before account lockout.

| Value | Security Level |
|-------|----------------|
| **3** | Default, recommended |
| **5** | More lenient |
| **10** | Very lenient |

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Lockout Duration:** 5 minutes (not configurable)

After hitting the max attempts, the account is locked for 5 minutes.
