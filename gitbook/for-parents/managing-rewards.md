## Reward Strategy Tips

### Make It Motivating

{% hint style="success" %}
**Ask your kids what they want!**

They'll work harder for rewards they actually care about.
{% endhint %}

### Balance the Store

Good reward stores have:
- ✅ Several small rewards (quick wins)
- ✅ A few medium rewards (weekly goals)
- ✅ 1-2 big rewards (long-term motivation)

### Keep It Fresh

- Add new rewards occasionally
- Remove rewards nobody wants
- Adjust prices based on popularity

### Be Realistic

Only offer rewards you're willing to give! Don't promise things you can't deliver.

## When Rewards Are Claimed

What happens when a child clicks on a reward:

1. Points are **instantly deducted**
2. A confirmation message appears
3. **You should honor the reward!**

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important: Follow Through!**

If you don't give the reward after they "buy" it, kids will lose trust in the system. Always honor claimed rewards.
{% endhint %}

## Sample Reward Setup

Here's a balanced reward store to start with:

| Reward | Cost | Category |
|--------|------|----------|
| 30 min extra screen time | 15 | Screen Time |
| Choose dinner for family | 25 | Special Privilege |
| Movie night pick | 30 | Entertainment |
| Special treat from store | 40 | Treats |
| Skip one chore day | 35 | Break |
| Friend sleepover | 60 | Social |

Feel free to customize based on what motivates YOUR family!
