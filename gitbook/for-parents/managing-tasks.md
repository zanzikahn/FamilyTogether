## Task Settings Explained

When editing a task, you can set:

| Setting | Description | Examples |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Task Name** | What the task is called | "Sweep kitchen floor" |
| **Assignee** | Who should do it | Everyone, Kids, specific name |
| **Points** | How many points it's worth | 1-25 typically |
| **Time (minutes)** | Estimated time to complete | 5, 10, 15, 30, etc. |
| **Individual Task** | Does everyone do it separately? | ☑️ for "Make beds" |

---

## Assignee Options

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Everyone" %}
### All Family Members

Any family member can complete this task.

**Use for:** General household tasks anyone can do

**Examples:** Clear table, evening tidy-up
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Kids" %}
### Children Only

Only accounts marked as "Child" (not parents) can complete.

**Use for:** Tasks specifically for children

**Examples:** Put toys away, homework area cleanup
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Specific Person" %}
### One Family Member

Only the named person can complete this task.

**Use for:** Age-appropriate or specialized tasks

**Examples:** Teen-specific chores, youngest child's simple tasks
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Combinations" %}
### Parent + Child

Tasks that require teamwork.

**Options:**
- Parent + Teen
- Parent + Child
- Parent + Kids

**Use for:** Tasks needing supervision or help

**Examples:** Deep cleaning, learning new skills
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Individual Task Setting

{% hint style="info" %}
**Check "Individual Task" when EACH person needs to do it separately.**
{% endhint %}

### When to Check ☑️ Individual Task:

| Task | Individual? | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Make beds | ☑️ Yes | Each person makes their OWN bed |
| Put away own clothes | ☑️ Yes | Each person handles their own |
| Vacuum living room | ❌ No | Only needs to be done once |
| Wash dishes | ❌ No | One person does it |

### How It Works:

**Individual = ON:**
- Each assigned person sees the task
- Each person must complete it separately
- Completion shows "2/4 done" style counter
- Each person earns points when they complete their part

**Individual = OFF:**
- Only one person needs to complete it
- First person to complete gets the points
- Shows as done for everyone after completion

## Setting Point Values

Use this guide to set fair point values:

| Task Difficulty | Time | Suggested Points |
|-----------------|------|------------------|
| Very Easy | 2-5 min | 1-2 points |
| Easy | 5-10 min | 2-4 points |
| Medium | 10-20 min | 4-8 points |
| Hard | 20-45 min | 8-15 points |
| Very Hard | 45+ min | 15-25 points |

{% hint style="success" %}
**Tip:** Harder or less popular tasks should be worth more points to motivate completion!
{% endhint %}

|--------|--------------|
| 🔄 Reset Daily | Clear all daily completions (use each morning) |
| 🔄 Reset Weekly | Clear all weekly completions (use each week) |
| 🔄 Reset Monthly | Clear all monthly completions (use each month) |

## Best Practices

1. **Start simple** — Don't overwhelm with too many tasks initially
2. **Age-appropriate** — Assign tasks kids can actually do
3. **Be specific** — "Clean your room" is vague; "Put toys in bins" is clear
4. **Review regularly** — Adjust tasks as kids grow and learn
5. **Balance** — Mix easy and hard tasks so everyone can earn points
