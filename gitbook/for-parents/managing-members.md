## Adjusting Points Manually

Sometimes you need to adjust someone's points:

**Reasons to ADD points:**
- Completed a task outside the app
- Bonus for exceptional work
- Making up for a mistake
- Birthday bonus!

**Reasons to REMOVE points:**
- Correcting an error
- Consequence for behavior
- Points given by mistake

### How to Adjust:

1. Click **"✏️ Edit"** on their profile
2. Change the Points value
3. Click **"💾 Save"**

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Be Fair!**

Manual point adjustments should be rare and justified. Kids should primarily earn points through task completion.

## Password Best Practices

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="For Young Kids" %}
### Simple & Memorable

- Use short, easy words
- Something they can remember
- Example: `puppy1` `star123` `happy`

{% hint style="success" %}
**Tip:** Let them choose their own simple password — they'll remember it better!
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="For Older Kids/Teens" %}
### More Secure

- Longer passwords
- Mix of letters and numbers
- Something meaningful to them
- Example: `soccer2024` `gaming4life`
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="For Parents" %}
### Secure

- Don't use easy-to-guess passwords
- Different from other accounts
- Remember: kids might try to guess it!
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Default Family Setup

FamilyTogether comes with example members:

| Name | Role | Default Password |
|------|------|------------------|
| Parent 1 | Parent | parent123 |
| Parent 2 | Parent | parent456 |
| Teen (15) | Child | teen123 |
| Child (7) | Child | child123 |

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Change these defaults!**

Edit each profile to:
1. Use real names
2. Set unique passwords
3. Choose appropriate avatars
{% endhint %}

---

## Tips

1. **Use recognizable avatars** — Pick emojis that match each person
2. **Keep passwords accessible** — You can always check them in the admin panel
3. **Start fresh if needed** — Delete default members and create your own
4. **One account per person** — Don't share accounts
