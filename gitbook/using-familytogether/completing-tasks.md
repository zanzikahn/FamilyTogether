# Completing Tasks

This is the most important part! Here's how to complete tasks and earn points.

## The Complete Process

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Do the Real Work

First, actually complete the chore in real life!

- Read the task name carefully
- Do the cleaning or chore properly
- Make sure it's done well (parents will check!)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Find the Task in the App

Go to your dashboard and find the task you completed.

Look for tasks with a green **"✅ Submit for Approval"** button.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Click Submit

Click the **"✅ Submit for Approval"** button on the task card.

The card will turn yellow showing "Pending."
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Wait for Approval

A parent needs to verify you did the work.

- They'll check if the real chore was done properly
- If good: **Approved!** Points added to your balance
- If not: **Rejected** with feedback on what to fix
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Be Honest!**

Only submit a task after you've actually done the work. Parents will check, and submitting tasks you haven't done is not honest.
{% endhint %}

This means the parent wants you to do a better job. It's a chance to improve!

### Steps to Fix a Rejected Task

2. **Go back and fix** whatever wasn't done right
3. **Make it better** than before
4. Click **"🔄 Resubmit"** when you're done
5. **Wait** for the parent to check again

### "Everyone" Tasks

When a task says "Assigned to: Everyone":

{% tab title="Individual Task" %}
If it has an **"Individual task"** badge:
- EACH person needs to do it
- Example: "Make beds" - everyone makes their OWN bed

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Group Task" %}
If there's NO "Individual task" badge:
- Only ONE person needs to do it
- First person to complete it gets the points
- Example: "Vacuum living room"
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
