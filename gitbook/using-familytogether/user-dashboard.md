# The User Dashboard

When you log in, you'll see your personal dashboard. This is where all the action happens!

## Dashboard Overview

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/dashboard-placeholder.png" alt="User Dashboard"><figcaption><p>Figure: The User Dashboard shows your points, rewards, and tasks</p></figcaption></figure>

---

## Your Points Display

At the very top, you'll see a colorful purple-blue box showing your total points.

{% hint style="success" %}
**⭐ Your Points**

This number goes UP every time a parent approves your completed task!
{% endhint %}

| What You See | What It Means |
|--------------|---------------|
| Big number | Your total spendable points |
| Star icon (⭐) | Points symbol |

**Points are like money** — save them or spend them in the Reward Store!

---

## The Reward Store

Below your points, you'll see the **Reward Store** with cards for each available reward.

### Understanding Reward Cards

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Can Afford ✅" %}
### Purple Border = You Can Buy It!

When a reward has a **purple border** and purple background:
- You have enough points
- Click to claim it instantly!
- Points will be deducted
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Can't Afford Yet ❌" %}
### Gray Border = Need More Points

When a reward has a **gray border**:
- You don't have enough points yet
- The card shows how many more you need
- Keep completing tasks!
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Reward Card Information

Each reward card shows:
- **Name:** What you'll get (e.g., "30 min extra screen time")
- **Category:** Type of reward (Screen Time, Treats, etc.)
- **Cost:** How many points needed (purple badge)

## Understanding Task Cards

Each task appears as a card with important information:

### Card Layout

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Task Name                    [5 pts]   │
│                               ⏰ 10min   │
│  👤 Assigned to: Everyone               │
│  Completed: 0/3                         │
│                                         │
│              [✅ Submit for Approval]   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Card Information Explained

| Element | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Task Name** | What you need to do |
| **Points (blue badge)** | How many points you'll earn |
| **Time (⏰)** | About how long it takes |
| **Assignee (👤)** | Who should do this task |
| **Completed** | How many people have done it |
| **Button** | Action you can take |

---

## Task Card Colors

The background color of a task card tells you its status:

| Card Color | Status | Meaning |
|------------|--------|---------|
| ⬜ White/Gray | Not started | Ready for you to complete |
| 🟨 Yellow | Pending | Waiting for parent approval |
| 🟥 Red | Rejected | Needs to be redone |
| ✅ "Completed" label | Approved | Done! Points earned! |

---

## Individual vs. Group Tasks

{% hint style="info" %}
**Look for the "Individual task" badge!**

Some tasks marked "Everyone" need to be done by each person separately.
{% endhint %}

### Examples:

| Task | Type | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| "Make beds" | Individual | Each person makes their OWN bed |
| "Vacuum living room" | Group | Only ONE person needs to do it |

For individual tasks, the "Completed" counter shows how many family members have done it (e.g., "2/4").

---

## The Header Bar

At the top of your dashboard, you'll see:

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| 🏠 Title | "Family Cleaning Tracker" |
| Avatar + Name | Shows who's logged in |
| ⚙️ Admin button | Switch to Admin Panel (parents only) |
| Logout button | Return to login screen |
