**Make Your Points Count!**
{% endhint %}

1. **Make a goal** — Decide what you want to save for
2. **Check your balance** — Know how many points you have
3. **Do the math** — How many tasks until you can afford it?
4. **Resist impulse buys** — Don't blow points on small stuff if you want something big
5. **Celebrate big purchases** — You earned it!

---

## Can I Get Points Back?

**No.** Once you claim a reward, the points are gone.

If you change your mind after clicking, you cannot get a refund.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Think Before You Click!**

Ask yourself:
- Do I really want this?
- Is there something better I should save for?
- Can I earn more points soon?
{% endhint %}

## What If a Reward I Want Costs Too Much?

1. **Keep completing tasks** — Every task adds points
2. **Focus on bigger tasks** — Weekly and monthly tasks give more points
3. **Ask about bonus points** — Parents can set point multipliers for special occasions
4. **Be patient** — Good things come to those who wait!
