## Instructions for Claude Code

**Update this file**:
1. At the start of each development session
2. After completing each task
3. When switching between components
4. When encountering blockers
5. At the end of each development session
6. After each phase completion

**Keep it accurate**: This is the single source of truth for project state.

**Be specific**: Include URLs, file paths, exact counts, and precise status.
